# Project Description: My Favorite Recipe Website

I created a website using basic HTML functionalities.Users can navigate through the pages to find detailed recipes, ingredients, and cooking instructions for various dishes.

# Learnings from the Project: HTML Basics

Through this project, I gained a solid understanding of HTML's foundational syntax and structure. Key learnings include:

1. **HTML Document Structure:**
   - Utilized the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags to structure the document appropriately.
   - Incorporated the `<title>` tag within the `<head>` section to define the webpage title.

2. **Page Content:**
   - Employed structural elements like headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) to organize content hierarchically.
   - Used paragraphs (`<p>`) for text content and lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) for itemized information.

3. **Hyperlinks and Images:**
   - Implemented hyperlinks (`<a>`) to connect different pages within the website or link to external resources.
   - Embedded images (`<img>`) to enhance visual appeal and provide a better user experience.

This project not only allowed me to create a personal recipe website but also deepened my understanding of HTML's core concepts, setting a strong foundation for future web development endeavors.
